Things to Look for in Project:
	* Adaptive Histogram Equalization
	* Adaptive Contrast Stretching
	* That method proposed in paper
	* noise reduction by median filter

Things already done:
	*Histogram Equalization for b/w images
	*Adjustment by Alpha
	*For Couloured images by converting to HSV colorspace
	*Basic contrast stretching(2 algorithms done yet).
